# Feature Requests

## version
Print out version of probcli running.
--> this could be implemented by allowing access to external functions in Jupyter
    PROB_INFO_STR("prob-version") would then return this information
    
## z3/cvc4/kodkod:
Allow predicates to be evaluated with an alternate backend

## setting preferences
E.g, -p MAXINT 128
Could also be accomplished by the SET_PREF external function

## pretty print a B formula in Latex/Unicode
Be able to pretty print a formula, possibly without evaluating it.


## Displaying evaluation results

### show result of an evaluation as a table
E.g., show {1|->"a", 2|->"b"} as a table.

### show result of an evaluation as a dot/sfdp graph

### show result of an evaluation as a chart

### display ANIMATION_FUNCTION as a table/grid in the notebook


## other probcli REPL commands

### show type of a formula

### let, unlet, store

### browse lets and stored results


## Animation

### allow to execute an operation
similar to :exec or -animate Nr probcli REPL commands

### allow to execute other dot commands
i.e., machine hierarchy, ...
