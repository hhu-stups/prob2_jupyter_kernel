# Feature Requests

Features marked with **, *** would be useful or very useful for the presentation at ABZ in June.

## version
Print out version of probcli running.
--> this could be implemented by allowing access to external functions in Jupyter
    PROB_INFO_STR("prob-version") would then return this information.
    To enable this one would need to load a machine
    MACHINE Jupyter
    DEFINITIONS "LibraryMeta.def"; "LibraryStrings.def" END
    
## z3/cvc4/kodkod:  ***
Allow predicates to be evaluated with an alternate backend

## pretty print a B formula in Latex/Unicode
Be able to pretty print a formula, possibly without evaluating it.

## asserting a predicate
This would be useful in a manual: ensure that the results
are as expected and print a big red warning if not.
For example:
 :assert DEC_STRING_TO_INT("10000000000000000000000000000000000",-32)=100

This could also be used as a kind of test or for
notebooks to be filled in by students, where the teacher
has added the asserts at the bottom.

## Displaying evaluation results

### additional details ***
providing timing information about evaluation; could be applicable
to all cells and be set by a prob2-jupyter preference
E.g.,
 :pref JUPYTER-SHOW-TIME=TRUE
 2+2
  --->  4
  --->  Evaluation time: 0.000 sec
  

### show result of an evaluation as a table **
E.g., show {1|->"a", 2|->"b"} as a table.

### show result of an evaluation as a dot/sfdp graph **

### show result of an evaluation as a chart

### display ANIMATION_FUNCTION as a table/grid in the notebook


## other probcli REPL commands

### show type of a formula

### let, unlet, store

### browse lets and stored results


## Animation and Model Checking

Note: we can either re-implement the commands in the Jupyter kernel
on top of ProB2, or we can add one command:
:probcli PROBCLI-COMMAND
which then delegates the execution and treatment to probcli
  (e.g., :probcli -mc 100)
### allow to execute an operation
similar to :exec or -animate Nr probcli REPL commands

### allow to execute other dot commands
i.e., machine hierarchy, ...

### model checking commands
-mc LIMIT
--model-check
-ltlformula FORMULA
-ctlformula FORMULA

### constraint-based checking commands
-cbc OPERATION
-bmc LIMIT
-cbc_deadlock
...

# Issues

## Unknown should be reported
In the chr_tests notebook, the second call to x>y & y>x
(with enumeration warning) should probably be accompanied by the result
UNKNOWN

## stdlib contents not available to ProB2 parser

::load
MACHINE Jupyter
    DEFINITIONS "LibraryMeta.def"; "LibraryStrings.def"
END
